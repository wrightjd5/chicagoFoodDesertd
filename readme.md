## About

This interactive map provides insights into the distribution of seniors living in food deserts across different census tracts in Chicago. Additionally, it highlights the locations of grocery stores to facilitate a better understanding of the accessibility of food resources for seniors in the city.

The inspiration for creating this map came after reading on article on the Chicago times regarding a problem with food deserts in the city, and how the local government plans to respond.
